### 2. What is Typescript?

- A JavaScript Superset.
- A Language building up on JS.
- Adds new Features + Advantages to JS. It makes writing JS code easier and more powerful.
- TS can't be executed by JS environments like the browsers. Features are complied to JS "workarounds."

### 2. Why TypeScript?

Catch unwanted behaviors like the following during development:

```
JavaScript

function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// Unwanted behavior at runtime
console.log(add('2', '3)); // '23' instead of 5 - a concatenated string of the two numbers

```

### 4. JS Notes

💛 笔记。

Note: In JS, when you access the value of an input element, it is _always_ a string, no matter which type of input it is. And when two strings are added in JS, they get concatenated instead of added mathmatically.

```
<input type="number" id="num1" placeholder=" Number 1" />
<input type="number" id="num2" placeholder=" Number 2" />
```

### 4. Installing & Using TypeScript

@index.html, @first-proj.js, @first-proj.ts

Install:
`npm install -g typescript`

Compile
`tsc helloworld.ts`

TypeScript adds ...

- Types!
- Next-gen JS Features (complied down for older Browsers)
- Non-JS Features like Interfaces or Generics
- Meta-Programming Features like Decorators
- Rich Configuration Options
- Modern Tooling that helps even in non-TS Projects
